# AboutWindowSeries (Pro Edition)

The **Pro** edition is the third example in the *AboutWindowSeries*, demonstrating how to integrate external API data into an About dialog in a Windows Forms application.

This version builds upon the **Enhanced** edition by:
- Fetching real-time data from the **GitHub API**.
- Displaying the latest release version of a specified GitHub repository.
- Providing a more advanced example of asynchronous programming in WinForms.

---

## 1. Purpose of the Example

The **Pro** edition showcases:
- Asynchronous API calls in a Windows Forms environment.
- Consuming and parsing JSON data from a public API.
- Displaying dynamic, up-to-date content in an About dialog.

---

## 2. How It Works

The application contains:

1. **ProProgram.cs**  
   - The application’s entry point.  
   - Initializes the Windows Forms environment.  
   - Opens the `ProAboutForm` on startup.

2. **ProAboutForm.cs**  
   - Controls the About dialog’s logic.  
   - On form load:
     - Displays the application version and a description.
     - Calls the `GitHubService` to fetch the latest release tag from a specified repository.
     - Updates the UI with the fetched data or shows an error message if the request fails.
   - Contains a **Close** button to exit the dialog.

3. **ProAboutForm.Designer.cs**  
   - Auto-generated by the Windows Forms designer.  
   - Lays out the controls:
     - Version label
     - Description label
     - GitHub information label
     - Close button

4. **GitHubService.cs**  
   - A dedicated class for communicating with the GitHub API.
   - Configures an `HttpClient` with required headers.
   - Sends asynchronous GET requests to retrieve the latest release data.
   - Parses JSON to extract the `tag_name` field.

## 3. Project Structure

```plaintext
AboutWindowSeries/
 └─ Pro/
     ├─ ProProgram.cs              # Entry point: starts ProAboutForm
     ├─ ProAboutForm.cs            # Logic for the Pro About window
     ├─ ProAboutForm.Designer.cs   # Auto-generated UI layout
     ├─ GitHubService.cs           # Handles GitHub API requests
```

---

## 4. Requirements

```plaintext
- .NET 6.0 or later
- Internet connection (required for GitHub API calls)
- GitHub API does not require authentication for public repos, but rate limits apply
```

---

## 5. Setting Up and Running the Example

### Step 1: Create a New WinForms Project
```bash
dotnet new winforms -n AboutPro
```

### Step 2: Replace the Default Files
Copy the provided `ProProgram.cs`, `ProAboutForm.cs`, `ProAboutForm.Designer.cs`, and `GitHubService.cs` into your project.

### Step 3: Build and Run
```bash
dotnet run
```

---

## 6. Customizing the Pro About Window

### Change the Target GitHub Repository
Inside `ProAboutForm.cs`:
```csharp
var repoInfo = await _gitHubService.GetLatestReleaseAsync("dotnet", "runtime");
```
Replace `"dotnet"` and `"runtime"` with your desired GitHub owner and repository.

### Change the Description
In the `AboutForm_Load` method:
```csharp
lblDescription.Text = "Pro Edition - Includes GitHub integration";
```

### Change the Window Title
In `ProAboutForm.Designer.cs`:
```csharp
this.Text = "About - Pro Edition";
```

---

## 7. How GitHub Integration Works

1. When the form loads, it calls:
   ```csharp
   await _gitHubService.GetLatestReleaseAsync(owner, repo);
   ```
2. `GitHubService` sends a GET request to:
   ```
   https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest
   ```
3. The JSON response is parsed, extracting `tag_name`.
4. The latest release tag is displayed in the About dialog.
