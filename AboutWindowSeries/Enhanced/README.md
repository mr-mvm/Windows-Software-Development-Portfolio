# AboutWindowSeries (Enhanced)

The **Enhanced** example is the second entry in the *AboutWindowSeries*, a collection of example projects demonstrating various implementations of "About" dialogs in Windows Forms applications.

This example extends the **Basic** version by:
- Adding persistent storage of user-provided information.
- Allowing the user to edit and save extra details.
- Loading previously saved information when the window opens.

It is designed to show how to integrate a simple configuration file mechanism into an About dialog.

## 1. Purpose of the Example

While the **Basic** example focuses on static information, this **Enhanced** version introduces the ability to **store and retrieve dynamic data**.

Common uses include:
- Allowing the user to store notes, license information, or registration keys.
- Retaining support contact details or user-specific identifiers.
- Demonstrating simple file I/O in WinForms.

---

## 2. How It Works

The application contains:

1. **EnhancedProgram.cs**  
   - Serves as the application’s entry point.  
   - Initializes the Windows Forms environment.  
   - Opens the `EnhancedAboutForm` when the program starts.

2. **EnhancedAboutForm.cs**  
   - Controls the About dialog’s logic.  
   - Uses a `ConfigManager` to load and save data to a text file.  
   - Displays saved information in a label.  
   - Allows the user to edit information via a text box.  
   - Includes a **Save** button to persist changes.

3. **EnhancedAboutForm.Designer.cs**  
   - Auto-generated by the Windows Forms designer.  
   - Lays out the controls:  
     - A label for showing saved data.  
     - A multiline text box for editing.  
     - A Save button.

4. **EnhancedConfigManager.cs**  
   - Handles reading from and writing to a configuration file (`config.txt`).  
   - Provides methods to:
     - Read the file if it exists.
     - Write new content to the file.

## 3. Project Structure

```plaintext
AboutWindowSeries/
 └─ Enhanced/
     ├─ EnhancedProgram.cs            # Entry point: starts EnhancedAboutForm
     ├─ EnhancedAboutForm.cs          # Logic for the enhanced About window
     ├─ EnhancedAboutForm.Designer.cs # Auto-generated UI layout
     ├─ EnhancedConfigManager.cs               # Handles reading/writing config file
```

## 4. Requirements

```plaintext
- .NET 6.0 or later
  (Adaptable to .NET Framework by replacing ApplicationConfiguration.Initialize()
   with Application.EnableVisualStyles() and SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false))
```

---

## 5. Setting Up and Running the Example

### Step 1: Create a New WinForms Project
```bash
dotnet new winforms -n AboutEnhanced
```

### Step 2: Replace the Default Files
Copy the provided `EnhancedProgram.cs`, `EnhancedAboutForm.cs`, `EnhancedAboutForm.Designer.cs`, and `EnhancedConfigManager.cs` from this repository into your project.

### Step 3: Build and Run
```bash
dotnet run
```
The application will open with the enhanced About window.

---

## 6. Customizing the Enhanced About Window

### Change the Window Title
```csharp
this.Text = "About - Enhanced";
```

### Change the Default Saved Information Label
```csharp
lblInfo.Text = "Saved Information";
```

### Change the Configuration File Name
Inside `EnhancedAboutForm.cs`:
```csharp
EnhancedconfigManager = new EnhancedConfigManager("config.txt");
```
Change `"config.txt"` to another filename as needed.

---

## 7. How Persistence Works

When the form loads:
1. The `EnhancedConfigManager.ReadConfig()` method checks if `config.txt` exists.
2. If it exists, the file’s contents are displayed in `lblInfo`.

When the Save button is clicked:
1. The text from `txtInfo` is passed to `EnhancedConfigManager.WriteConfig()`.
2. The file is overwritten with the new data.
3. The label is updated to show the new saved information.

## 9. Part of AboutWindowSeries

This is **Example 2: Enhanced**. It builds upon **Example 1 — Basic** by introducing data persistence and user-editable content.
