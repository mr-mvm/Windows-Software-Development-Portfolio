# AboutWindowSeries (Basic)

The **Basic** example is the first entry in the *AboutWindowSeries*, a set of example projects demonstrating different ways to implement "About" dialogs in Windows Forms applications.

This specific example focuses on creating a **minimal About window** that:
- Shows the application name.
- Displays the current version number.
- Provides a short description.
- Includes an OK button to close the dialog.

It uses the [MaterialSkin](https://github.com/IgnaceMaes/MaterialSkin) library to give the form a modern, Material Design-inspired appearance.

## 1. Purpose of the Example

An "About" dialog is a small, standard part of many desktop applications.  
Its main purposes are:
- Informing the user about the software’s name and version.
- Offering a brief description or credit.
- Providing a polished, professional feel.

This **Basic** example is designed as a *starter template*. It’s intentionally kept minimal so you can easily adapt and expand it to suit your own application.

---

## 2. How It Works

The application contains:

1. **Program.cs**  
   - Acts as the entry point of the program.  
   - Initializes the Windows Forms environment.  
   - Opens the `AboutForm` as the main window.

2. **AboutForm.cs**  
   - Implements the About dialog’s behavior.  
   - Configures MaterialSkin styling (theme, color scheme).  
   - Sets label text for the app name, version, and description.  
   - Includes an event handler for the OK button that closes the form.

3. **AboutForm.Designer.cs**  
   - Auto-generated by the Windows Forms designer.  
   - Defines the layout: positions labels and the OK button.  
   - Sets font sizes, margins, and other UI properties.

The MaterialSkin `MaterialForm` base class is used instead of the standard `Form`, which allows the dialog to adopt Material Design UI elements and themes.

## 3. Project Structure

```plaintext
AboutWindowSeries/
 └─ Basic/
     ├─ BasicProgram.cs            # Entry point: starts AboutForm
     ├─ BasicAboutForm.cs          # Logic for the About window
     ├─ BasicAboutForm.Designer.cs # Auto-generated UI layout
```

## 4. Requirements

```plaintext
- .NET 6.0 or later
  (Adaptable to .NET Framework by replacing ApplicationConfiguration.Initialize()
   with Application.EnableVisualStyles() and SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false))

- MaterialSkin.2 NuGet package
  Provides Material Design controls and styling.
```

## 5. Setting Up and Running the Example

### Step 1: Create a New WinForms Project
```bash
dotnet new winforms -n AboutBasic
```

### Step 2: Install MaterialSkin
```bash
dotnet add package MaterialSkin.2
```

### Step 3: Replace the Default Files
Copy the provided `Program.cs`, `AboutForm.cs`, and `AboutForm.Designer.cs` from this repository into your project.  
These files will overwrite the default `Program.cs` and `Form1` files created by the template.

### Step 4: Build and Run
```bash
dotnet run
```
The application should open with the About window displayed.

---

## 6. Customizing the About Window

### Change the Application Name
```csharp
lblAppName.Text = "MyApp";
```

### Change the Description
```csharp
lblDescription.Text = "A small demo About window for portfolio.";
```

### Change the Theme and Colors
```csharp
materialSkinManager.Theme = MaterialSkinManager.Themes.LIGHT;
materialSkinManager.ColorScheme = new ColorScheme(
    Primary.Blue600, Primary.Blue700, Primary.Blue200,
    Accent.LightBlue200, TextShade.WHITE
);
```

### Change the Version Display
By default, the version is read from the assembly:
```csharp
lblVersion.Text = $"Version {GetVersion()}";
```
Or set it manually:
```csharp
lblVersion.Text = "Version 1.0.0";
```

## 7. Why Use MaterialSkin?

MaterialSkin brings:
- A cleaner, more modern appearance to WinForms apps.
- Easy-to-use themes and color schemes.
- Controls like `MaterialLabel` and `MaterialButton` that are styled automatically.

Without MaterialSkin, a WinForms About window may look outdated on modern systems.
